    "In Python, the open() function is used to open a file. It takes the filename as a parameter and returns a file object that allows you to interact with the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different modes of opening a file are:\n",
    "\n",
    "'r' (Read mode): This is the default mode. It opens the file for reading. If the file does not exist, it raises a FileNotFoundError. When a file is opened in read mode, you can only read its contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "'w' (Write mode): This mode opens the file for writing. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file. If the file already exists, it truncates its contents. In write mode, you can write data to the file and overwrite its existing contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "'a' (Append mode): This mode opens the file for appending. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file. If the file already exists, it appends the data to the end of the file without truncating its contents. In append mode, new data is added to the existing contents of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "'x' (Exclusive creation mode): This mode is used to create a new file but raises a FileExistsError if the file already exists. It prevents accidentally overwriting an existing file.\n",
    "\n",
    "'t' (Text mode): This is the default mode and it opens the file in text mode. In this mode, the file is treated as a text file and data is read or written as strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "'b' (Binary mode): This mode opens the file in binary mode. It is used to read or write binary data such as images, audio files, etc. In binary mode, data is read or written as bytes."
